    /// It allowed publishers to give users a time-based free trial of software.
    /// Based on "Asc005.dll" and "Asc006.exe", AegiSoft License Manager may also have been referred to as "Software-On-Demand License Manager", or it may just be a distinct component of the larger product.
    /// The single sample investigated was only able to run on Windows 9x (Redump entry 73521/IA item "Nova_HoyleCasino99USA").
    /// Based on the packaging from IA item "Nova_HoyleCasino99USA", it seems that additional software from "www.1-800-software.com" is likely to be protected with AegiSoft License Manager or other DRM.
