        // intersected by the physical ring.
        // This file is usually called ZDAT, but not always. At least one instance of Light calls it ZDATA. At least one
        // instance of Professional calls it System.
        // Seemingly it can be anything. It doesn't help that most known samples are specifically from one company's
        // games, Tivola. Still, most use ZDAT.

        // All instances of professional contain a disc check, performed via optgraph.dll.

        // Due to gov's minor name variance, sound.x64 sometimes being intersected by a ring at the start, and
        // iofile.x64 being referenced directly in optgraph.x64, only iofile.x64 is being checked for now.
        // TODO: optgraph.dll also contains DRM to prevent kernel debugger SoftICE from being used, via a process called
        // SoftICE-Test. It is not currently known if this is specifically part of copy-X, or if it's an external
        // solution employed by both copy-X and also other companies. If it's the latter, it should have its own check.
