    /// SafeWrap (https://web.archive.org/web/20010803054324/http://www.macrovision.com:80/solutions/software/safewrap.php3) is a wrapper created by Macrovision used to protect software.
    /// It's used (to an unknown extent) within SafeCast and SafeDisc (https://web.archive.org/web/20030829044647/http://www.macrovision.com:80/solutions/software/SafeWrap_FAQ_July2003.pdf Section #3).
    /// It can be used separately from any other Macrovision product, such as (supposedly) for RioPort (https://www.cdrinfo.com/d7/content/macrovision-invests-next-generation-security-and-transport-technologies-internet-delivery).
    /// No direct SafeWrap only sample has currently been found, nor is it exactly clear what parts of SafeCast/SafeDisc are SafeWrap.
    /// It's claimed that SafeWrap uses one DLL and one .SYS "security driver" (https://web.archive.org/web/20030829044647/http://www.macrovision.com:80/solutions/software/SafeWrap_FAQ_July2003.pdf Section #30).
    /// This would appear to be referring to the "drvmgt.dll" and "secdrv.sys" files, the latter of which is officially referred to as the "Macrovision SECURITY Driver" in some SafeDisc versions.
    /// This may not be fully accurate, as not all of these files are known to always be used with SafeCast, though this does need further investigation.
    /// The .stxt* sections found in various Macrovision products may indicate SafeWrap, as they started being used around the time that SafeWrap was made public.
    /// It may also be that the "BoG" string known to be present in Macrovision executables could be related to SafeWrap, though its use predates the first known mention of SafeWrap by a few years.
    /// SafeWrap may have its origins in SafeDisc-related tech if that's the case, further confusing matters.
    /// This unforuantely has several possible unpleasant implications for current checks, such as if the X.YY.ZZZ version string is a generic property of SafeWrap and can be non-standard when used for different products.
    /// Currently, no known patents or trademarks for SafeWrap have been found.
