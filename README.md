# BurnOutSharp

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/gmdft5bk1h8a1c31?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mnadareski/burnoutsharp)

C# port of the protection scanning ability of [BurnOut](http://burnout.sourceforge.net/) plus numerous updates and additions. This currently compiles as a library so it can be used in any C# application. For an example of usage, see [MPF](https://github.com/SabreTools/MPF).

In addition to the original BurnOut code, the following libraries (or ports thereof) are used for file handling:

- [HLExtract](https://github.com/Rupan/HLLib) - Various Valve archive format extraction
- [libmspack4n](https://github.com/activescott/libmspack4n) - Microsoft CAB extraction
- [psxt001z](https://github.com/Dremora/psxt001z) - PS1 LibCrypt detection
- [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress) - 7zip/GZip/RAR/PKZIP extraction
- [StormLibSharp](https://github.com/robpaveza/stormlibsharp) - MPQ extraction
- [UnshieldSharp](https://github.com/mnadareski/UnshieldSharp) - InstallShield CAB extraction
- [WiseUnpacker](https://github.com/mnadareski/WiseUnpacker) - Wise Installer extraction
- [WixToolset.Dtf](https://github.com/wixtoolset/Dtf) - MSI extraction

## Protections Detected

Below is a list of protections detected by BurnOutSharp. The two columns explain what sort of checks are performed to determine how the protection is detected. Generally speaking, it's better to have a content check than a path check.

¹ - This means that I have not obtained one or more samples to ensure that either the original check from BurnOut or information found online is correct.

² - This is the same as ¹, but only for a subset of the checks.
