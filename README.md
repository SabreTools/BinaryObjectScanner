# BurnOutSharp

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/gmdft5bk1h8a1c31?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mnadareski/burnoutsharp)

C# protection, packer, and archive scanning library. This currently compiles as a library so it can be used in any C# application. A reference application called `Test` is also included to demonstrate the abilities of the library. For an example of a program implementing the library, see [MPF](https://github.com/SabreTools/MPF).

The following libraries (or ports thereof) are used for file handling:

- [openmcdf](https://github.com/ironfede/openmcdf) - MSI extraction
- [psxt001z](https://github.com/Dremora/psxt001z) - PS1 LibCrypt detection [Ported to C#]
- [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress) - Common archive format extraction
- [SharpZipLib](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib) - zlib-based extraction
- [StormLibSharp](https://github.com/robpaveza/stormlibsharp) - MoPaQ extraction [Unused in .NET 6.0 builds due to Windows-specific libraries]
- [UnshieldSharp](https://github.com/mnadareski/UnshieldSharp) - InstallShield CAB extraction
- [WiseUnpacker](https://github.com/mnadareski/WiseUnpacker) - Wise Installer extraction

The following projects have influenced this library:

- [BurnOut](http://burnout.sourceforge.net/) - Project that this library was initially based on. The only thing left from that original port is in the name of the library. This project is fully unaffiliated with the original BurnOut and its authors.
- [HLLibSharp](https://github.com/mnadareski/HLLibSharp) - Documentation around Valve package handling, including extraction.
- [libbdplus](https://www.videolan.org/developers/libbdplus.html) - Documentation around the BD+ SVM files.
- [libmspack](https://github.com/kyz/libmspack) - Documentation around the MS-CAB format and associated compression methods.
- [NDecrypt](https://github.com/SabreTools/NDecrypt) - NDS (Nitro) and 3DS cart image file layouts and documentation, though not encrypt/decrypt.

Please visit our sibling project, [DRML](https://github.com/TheRogueArchivist/DRML), the DRM Library for a more in-depth look at some of the protections detected.

## Protections Detected

Below is a list of protections detected by BurnOutSharp. The two columns explain what sort of checks are performed to determine how the protection is detected. Generally speaking, it's better to have a content check than a path check.

**Notes**

¹ - This means that I have not obtained one or more samples to ensure that either the original check from BurnOut or information found online is correct.

² - This is the same as ¹, but only for a subset of the checks.

## Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome. Please follow the current coding styles and please do not add any keys or legally dubious things to the code. Thank you to all of the testers, particularly from the MPF project who helped get this rolling.

## Special Thanks

I want to give a special thanks to [TheRogueArchivist](https://github.com/TheRogueArchivist) who has gone above and beyond helping both fix existing checks as well as add new ones.
