    /// More specifically, it may have been created a spin-off division known as "Panlok" (https://cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_protections_copylok.shtml).
    /// Though it may also be that "PanLok" was an alternate name for the program itself (https://gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_generic_copylok.shtml).
    /// There was a PanLok website, but it's unknown what content it had hosted (https://web.archive.org/web/20041215075727/http://www.panlok.com/).
    /// 
    /// CopyLok made use of bad sectors, using an average of 720-750 per disc, and appears to have been a form of ring protection (http://forum.redump.org/topic/29842/issues-dumping-pc-disc-with-code-lock-copy-protection/).
    /// At least one disc with CopyLok appears to contain an excerpt of the poem "Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll in the raw sector data (http://forum.redump.org/post/54050/#p54050).
    /// According to the Readme for poxylok (https://gf.wiretarget.com/copylok.htm), some version of Gangsters 2 may have this protection.
    /// 
    /// Previous versions of BurnOutSharp incorrectly reported this DRM as "CodeLock / CodeLok / CopyLok". It was later discovered that due to the similar names, two entirely different DRM were erroneously lumped together.
    /// "CodeLock" (in this case actually referring to "Code-Lock") is an entirely separate form of DRM, with the existing check now getting used separately.
    /// Also not to be confused with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Northen_copylock.
