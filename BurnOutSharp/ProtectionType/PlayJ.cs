    /// PlayJ (https://web.archive.org/web/20000815053956/http://www.playj.com/) by EverAd was a form of DRM protected audio that was intended to be distributed freely, but that showed advertisements to the listener.
    /// This format didn't live for very long, having started in the February of 2000 (https://web.archive.org/web/20000301013405/http://www.playj.com/digital_music.htm) and ending with the parent company shutting down in 2001 (https://www.thestreet.com/technology/everad-closes-down-after-having-raised-345m-in-past-two-years-1505964).
    /// The file format itself appears to be an encrypted MP3 (https://www.wired.com/2000/03/ads-take-aim-at-online-music/).
    /// The IANA assignment for the PlayJ format: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/audio/vnd.everad.plj
    /// The official player has been archived and can still be used to listen to the music (https://web.archive.org/web/20010417025347/http://dlp.playj.com:80/playj/PlayJIns266.exe).
    /// The music files themselves do not contain advertisements, which is instead handled on the side of the music players and plugins capable of playing the format.
    /// According to the ReadMe.txt found in https://web.archive.org/web/20010417025347/http://dlp.playj.com:80/playj/PlayJIns266.exe, there's 2 distinct versions of the format. The differences between versions are currently unknown.
    /// There are a few sources of PlayJ music archived online, these being a few examples:
