    /// MediaCloQ was a copy protection created by SunnComm to protect music CDs. It's a multisession CD, and all the audio tracks are erroneously marked as data tracks.
    /// Unlike other audio CD protections, this one doesn't give you an option to listen to the music off of PC or make "legitimate" copies.
    /// It does, however, have a data track containing a message that the CD is protected with MediaCloQ, and directs you to their website to purchase digital copies of the tracks.
    /// It appears that a version 2.0 was planned, and maybe even released, but so far no discs with MediaCloQ 2.0 are known (https://www.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_protections_mediacloq_v20.shtml, https://www.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/news/0108/mediacloq_20.shtml).
    /// The only known album to contain MediaCloQ is "Charley Pride - A Tribute to Jim Reeves", with the release that has the barcode "7 816190222-2 4" being confirmed to have it.
